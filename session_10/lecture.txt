Forms in Angular

Why forms?

Forms are essential for user input.
In our CCL2 app we use forms for:

- searching (quotes, broker codes, coverages, etc)
- selection (dropdowns)
- inputs (business name, prior insurer)
- getting answers (is policy change? is new business?)
- saving data

Angular provides wwo approaches:

- Reactive Forms (Model-driven, using FormGroup, FormControl)
- Template-Driven Forms (Using [(ngModel)] and directives)


Reactive Forms

Use:

- FormControl
- FormGroup
- FormArray
