Flexbox
Flexbox is a CSS layout model that makes it easy to design flexible and responsive layouts without relying on floats or positioning hacks. As a backend developer, you might not deal with UI often, but understanding Flexbox can help you tweak frontend layouts when needed.



Let's say we want to create a basic card component with:

A header, content area, and footer stacked vertically.

The footer should stick to the bottom even if content is short.

Everything should be centered horizontally.

This is surprisingly difficult with traditional CSS techniques!
