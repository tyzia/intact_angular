Recap Session 7
(delivered on Session 8)



Angular is a front-end framework.
It allows to create SPA (single-page application)
We have Angular v17.

SPA loads single file with JS and
refreshes the content of the page
without reloading the page itself.

We have 2 Angular apps:

1. Landing Page App
2. CCL2 Main App

Primary environments:
- INTG11 (develop branch)
- INTG08 (release branch)

User types:
- Brokers (external)
- Underwriters (internal)

git workflow

- Base branch: develop
- Branch naming: Jira ticket# (BROKER-4240)
- PR requirements:
  * Descriptive title with ticket#
  * Detailed description with screenshots
  * 2 approves
  * Passing ARS Junior tests

Open CCL2 locally

- ng serve -> http://localhost:4200
- ng serve --port 4201 -> http://localhost:4201
- ng serve --live-reload=false

Open CCL2 with specific quote locally

Open quote in INTG11
Using devtools, get contractVersionUuid from /contract call
(contractVersionUuid -> ddea8ddc-ab0d-4d86-b105-8830ccc665de)
> ng serve
http://localhost:4200?pd=ddea8ddc-ab0d-4d86-b105-8830ccc665de

Open CCL with mock server

Update fqclConfig.json to:
"fullQuoteServiceURL": "http://localhost:8090"
